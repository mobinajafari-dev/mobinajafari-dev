Hi! I'm Mobina, a Fullstack Developer specializing in JavaScript, Vue.js , and PHP. I build scalable, maintainable web applications and thrive on solving complex problems with elegant solutions.

Passionate about innovation, I’m actively seeking opportunities in Europe and open to relocation. I aim to contribute to international teams, deliver impactful products, and grow through diverse experiences.

Outside of coding, I explore emerging web technologies, optimize workflows, and actively engage with the developer community to stay at the forefront of industry trends.
